				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>Social media has become a primary source of information for many of us. As the number of users has grown, social network algorithms have evolved to prioritise content tailored to individual preferences.</p>
				<p>As a result, people often overconsume information they are already know and agree with. We become isolated in our filter bubbles, our perspectives narrow, we lose sight of the bigger picture, and the society becomes more polarised and aggressive.</p>

				<h3>Target audience</h3>
				<p>We focused on millennials, who are heavy users of digital tools and social media and are keen to monitor personal data such as health and fitness metrics. However, they often have limited information sources, remaining confined within personal filter bubbles.</p>
				<p>User interviews revealed common topics in their digital environments: personal development, climate change, responsible consumption, and politics. A shared concern among all personas was the experience of uncertainty, daily routine monotony, severe opinion polarisation, and an inability to engage with opposing viewpoints.</p>

				<h3>Proposal</h3>
				<p>Burst is an app designed to break your mental filter bubble by providing an alternative news feed. It combines interface elements from news and fitness apps, offering diverse content in an engaging and playful way.</p>
				<p>Overconsumption of social media can be likened to high-carb junk foodâ€”the easier to digest, the tastier. So, what can help combat what Eli Pariser called â€˜the digital obesityâ€™ and the â€˜isolated web of oneâ€™? Itâ€™s a healthy, balanced information feed that not only reinforces your beliefs but also opens your mind to new and unexpected ideas.</p>

			<div class="col-desc">
				<img src="images/burst/burst-diagram.png"/>
				<p>The horizontal axis represents the polarisation of opinions, while the vertical axis represents their relevance.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<p>Each piece of information can be measured by the mental effort requiredâ€”the cognitive work needed to overcome resistance factors such as self-righteousness, laziness, and narrow-mindedness. The greater the challenge, the more points it awards.</p>

				<h3>How it works</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Accessing your current information sources</strong><br>
					Connect your social media accounts (including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit) or manually set up an RSS feed to identify the most relevant topics.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Analysing the community</strong> âœ¨<br>
					By comparing the activities of different people, we can assess the level of&nbsp;polarisation.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Collecting the content that other media would filter out:</strong><br>
					ðŸ”¥ Opinions you might disagree with<br>
					ðŸ—‘ Subtopics you may find irrelevant<br>
					ðŸ™ˆ Facts you tend to ignore</li><br>
					<li><strong>Maintaining your motivation</strong><br>
					We achieve this by setting specific, achievable goals and incorporating gamification mechanics.
					</li><br>
					<li><strong>Escaping the filter bubble</strong><br>
					Even if you only skim the headlines, the alternative news feed will influence the way you think.</li>

				<h3>Community</h3>
				<p>You can also access the news feeds of other community members to see the world through their eyes and engage with them. As users accumulate points, their images become less blurry encouraging others to contact them. This increases shared topics and opinions, gradually reducing polarisation.</p>

				<h3>Gamification</h3>
				<p>We know very well that exploring new horizons can be challenging. Thatâ€™s why we help engage more people and keep them using the app by applying gamification mechanics. Following the idea of healthy and responsible consumption, <i>Burst</i> adopts methods and UI patterns popular in sports and health related products.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p><i>Burst</i> is not a real app but a concept designed to raise awareness of filter bubbles and their impact on society. It underscores the importance of balanced news consumption and the responsibility of news aggregators in shaping public opinion. Recommendation systems significantly influence our thoughts and feelings. Imagine if they adhered to these principles when curating your daily feed:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Provide fresh perspectives while keeping you informed</li>
					<li>Maintain balance, inspiration, and occasional amusement to support mental well-being</li>
					<li>Expand your horizons to encourage personal development</li>
				</ol>
