				<p>Social media has become one of the main sources of information for many of us. With the growth in the number of users, the algorithms of the social networks have developed, bringing the core principle â€” content related to you. Thus people tend to over-consume information they are already familiar with, information that they most likely agree with.</p>
				<p>As a result, we become isolated inside our filter bubbles, our outlook becomes narrower, we lose sight of the big picture, and the society becomes more polarised and aggressive.</p>

				<h2>The idea</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<p>Burst is an app that bursts your mental filter bubble by bringing an alternative news feed. The app mixes interface patterns of both news and fitness apps, thereby offering diverse content in a playful way.</p>
				<p>Social media overconsumption can be compared with high-carb junk food â€” the easier to digest, the tastier. So, what can help avoid what Eli Pariser called â€˜the digital obesityâ€™ and â€˜isolated web of oneâ€™? Itâ€™s a healthy and balanced information feed that not only assures you in your beliefs but lets you open your mind to the new and unexpected.</p>

				<p>The horizontal axis represents the polarisation of opinions, while the vertical axis represents their relevance.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<p>Every bit of information can be measured in mental efforts â€” the amount of cognitive work required to overcome resistance factors such as self-righteousness, laziness and narrow-mindedness. The tougher the challenge, the more points it brings.</p>

				<h2>How it works</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Getting access to your current sources of information</strong><br/>
					You can connect your social media accounts (incl. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit) or manually set up an RSS feed to define the most relevant topics.</li>
					<li><strong>Analysing the community</strong> âœ¨<br/>
					By comparing the activity of different people, weâ€™ll be able to detect the level of&nbsp;polarisation.</li>
					<li><strong>Composing the content that other media would find irrelevant for you:</strong><br/>
					ðŸ”¥ Opinions you most likely disagree with<br/>
					ðŸ—‘ Subtopics you may find irrelevant<br/>
					ðŸ™ˆ Facts you prefer to ignore</li>
					<li><strong>Keeping you motivated</strong><br/>
					We can reach this by setting specific and achievable goals rather than generic ones, and other gamification mechanics.</li>
					<li><strong>Escaping the filter bubble</strong><br/>
					Even if you only skim through the headlines, the alternative news feed will still affect the way you think.</li>

				<p>You can also access the news feeds of other community members to see the world through the eyes of your potential opponents or random strangers. The higher the total number of points earned by a user, the more their picture reveals. As a result, the amount of common topics and shared opinions gradually increases while the level of polarisation goes down.</p>
