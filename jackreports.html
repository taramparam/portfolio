				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>For decades, innovators have devised creative ways to track movement on a map. In the 1920s, drivers wore wrist maps, where a small map replaced the watch dial. In 1909, a scrolled map attached to the steering wheel was advertised. The Italian Touring Club went further in the 1930s, tethering the map scroll to a speedometer, creating the first device to show real-time position.</p>
				<p>Inspired by the evolution of navigation devices, we reimagined how truck drivers navigate today.</p>

				<h3>Target audience</h3>				
				<p><i>Jack Reports</i> is an app designed specifically for US truck drivers. Through user interviews, we explored the needs, preferences, and unique constraints that truckers face. They can‚Äôt park or turn wherever they want, and their primary focus is getting to their destination with minimal distraction. The funny thing is, unlike ordinary drivers, <strong>truckers don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs happening to the left of the road</strong> ‚Äì because they can‚Äôt get there fast enough anyway.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p><i>Jack Reports</i> initially launched as an AI-driven, community-supported database of truck-specific places. Drivers used it for trip planning but switched to conventional navigation apps while driving. This led to frequent distractions when checking place status updates.</p>
				<p>From a business perspective, this limited the time drivers spent in the app, reducing opportunities for engagement, community contributions, and potential monetisation.</p>

				<p><i>Highway</i> is a new app mode that represents any route as a straight line.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="block">
			<div class="col">
				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<p>We‚Äôre introducing the <i>Highway</i> mode, a new way to help truckers focus on what matters most:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>üöö&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortest route to the destination</li>
					<li>üöî&nbsp;&nbsp;Police inspections ahead</li>
					<li>üì¶&nbsp;&nbsp;Weigh station schedules and cargo requirements</li>
					<li>‚õîÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;State borders with estimated waiting times</li>
					<li>üöß&nbsp;&nbsp;Road accidents, dangerous zones, and bridge clearances</li>
					<li>‚û°Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Highway exits and rest areas available on the right</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The app offers two modes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Highway mode</strong>, a newly introduced, simplified, and focused view of essential points along the route.</li>
					<li><strong>Conventional map view</strong>, a detailed look at the entire route and nearby places.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Drivers can also check details, status updates, and reports from other community members.</p>
